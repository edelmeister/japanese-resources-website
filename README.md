# Japanese language resources for learners
https://edelmeister.github.io/japanese-resources-website/

This is a student project.

My goal was to create a simple website that compiles together my favorite Japanese language learning resources. Now whenever someone asks what resources I use, I can simply give them a link. Also, it's in dark mode, so feel free to browse at night.
